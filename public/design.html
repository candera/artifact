    Edit the file <code>public/design.html</code> to add links to this
    page. The files below are located in the <code>templates</code>
    directory. This area can be organized in many different ways. For
    the sample application, we have one page per view. Organizing
    templates as a palette
    like <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="refs">Twitter
    Bootstrap</a> is another valid approach.
    </p>

  <div class="section panel">
    <p>
    The sample application has two main views: form and greeting. The
    HTML for these views is located in the HTML files by the same name
    in the <code>templates</code> directory. The templates are
    extracted from these files
    in <code>src/app/clj-macros/one/sample/snippets.clj</code>. Changing
    these files will update the views in the ClojureScript application.

      <li><a href="/design/form.html">Form</a></li>
      <li><a href="/design/greeting.html">Greeting</a></li>
