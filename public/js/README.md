This directory is different from `public/javascripts`! This directory
holds JavaScripts that we need to serve up as-is to the application,
whereas `public/javascripts` holds the .js files that are generated by
the application.

Currently, this directory holds only one file, `xpath.js`, which must
be loaded in order to give IE XPath capability. Domina requires this.
