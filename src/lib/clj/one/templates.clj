  "Process a seq of Enlive nodes looking for `_include` and `_within` tags.
  Occurrences of `_include` are replaced by the resource to which they
  refer. The contents of `_within` tags are inserted into the resource
  to which they refer. `_within` is always the top-level tag in a file.
  `_include` can appear anywhere. Files with `_include` can reference
  files which themselves contain `_include` or `_within` tags, to an
  arbitrary level of nesting.
